The solver is located in pimpleFoamPulsTempNew.

It is designed to create a pulsating flow with a cosinusoidal pressure gradient, which will
also solve scalar temperature transport

The test case included is setup for the k-epsilon Launder-Sharma turbulence model with 
mesh such that y+ <= 1 at all phases.

The bottom wall is set to theta=1 and the top wall theta=0.

The dpdx magnitude and frequency are assigned in constant/transportProperties.

The viscosity is defined to be compared to a non-dimensional DNS simulation, as nu = 1/Re_tau
